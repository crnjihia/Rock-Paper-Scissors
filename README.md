# Rock Paper Scissors

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Project! This project is a simple web-based implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The game allows players to interact via buttons on a webpage rather than through console prompts.

## Project Structure

The project now includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web page.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the updated logic for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game with UI interaction.

## Updated Features

- Presents a UI with buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Dynamically updates the result and score display on the webpage.
- Removes the console-based interaction and replaces it with event-driven button clicks.
- Tracks scores and declares a winner once one player reaches 5 points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
   cd Rock-Paper-Scissors
   ```

### Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Click on the buttons for Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play a round.
3. The game will display the result of each round and update the score dynamically.
4. Continue playing until one player reaches 5 points, which will declare them as the winner.
