# Rock Paper Scissors

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Project! This project is a simple web-based implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The game is played entirely via the console and serves as an introductory exercise to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Features

- Randomly generates a computer choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
- Prompts the user for their choice.
- Plays a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- Keeps track of the scores for both the user and the computer.
- Plays 5 rounds and declares a winner based on the scores.
